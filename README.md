# 🌗 React Day 27 – Parent/Child Theme App

This version splits the app into two components:
- **App.js** holds the `darkMode` state and the logic.
- **ThemeSwitcher.js** receives props and triggers the parent's function.

### 🧠 What I practiced
- Parent → Child (props)
- Child → Parent (callback function)
- Component structure used in real React projects
